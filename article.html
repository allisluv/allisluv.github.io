    <article>
      <p><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/css-shapes-101">CSS Shapes 101</a> answered a lot of my questions about thinking outside of
        the box for website design. So far I have felt restricted to creating
        layouts based on stacked and layered rectangles and squares, but the
        article introduces me to infinite new options.</p>

      <p>The article had images of websites with layouts that were splashed
        across the page almost haphazardly. Though the images weren’t anything
        I personally wouldn’t want to use on a webpage, they gave me ideas for
        how to break out of a rectangular grid.</p>

      <p>Lots of code was provided to show exactly how to use and apply shapes
        to images and text. Unfortunately though, I was unable to implement any
        of the code examples. I tried to make a codepen with circle or
        pentagonal images, but I was unsuccessful. The code didn’t seem to do
        anything to the images at all. I’m not sure if “CSS Shapes” is a
        different part of the language that I would have to download to use, or
        if the browser I was using just doesn’t support it. I don’t know why I
        was unable to make it work, but my frustration lead me to other
        solutions.</p>

      <p>After seeing what could be done with CSS shapes, I had to figure out a
        way to break out of a rectangular grid. I ended up googling some ways to
        make shapes and what I found was pretty amazing. There are some simple
        explanations of how to round corners, or make circle and ovals, but one
        website had a list of code for increasingly complex shapes. It started
        with a circle and ovals and diamonds, but got to hearts, infinity signs,
        stars, and speech bubbles.</p>

      <p>Though the code for these was really intense and definitely not as
        powerful as the code in the article I read, it did work for me in
        codepen. Knowing that it is possible to make shapes besides rectangles
        has spurred my imagination for new website designs. I will look into how
        to make CSS shapes work, but for now I am content knowing that my
        options are open!</p>
