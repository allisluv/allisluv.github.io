      <p>CSS Shapes 101 answered a lot of my questions about thinking outside of
        the box for website design. So far I have felt restricted to creating
        layouts based on stacked and layered rectangles and squares, but the
        article introduces me to infinite new options.</p>

      <p>The article had images of websites with layouts that were splashed
        across the page almost haphazardly. Though the images weren’t anything I
        personally wouldn’t want to use on a webpage, they gave me ideas for how
        to break out of a rectangular grid.</p>

      <p>Lots of code was provided to show exactly how to use and apply shapes
        to images and text. Unfortunately though, I was unable to implement any
        of the code examples. I tried to make a codepen with circle or
        pentagonal images, but I was unsuccessful. The code didn’t seem to do
        anything to the images at all. I’m not sure if “CSS Shapes” is a
        different part of the language that I would have to download to use, or
        if the browser I was using just doesn’t support it. I don’t know why I
        was unable to make it work, but my frustration lead me to other
        solutions.</p>

      <p>Then moving on to the second page of the website, “Our Roasters,” I felt
        pretty comfortable with the code and had an example to work from. Though
        there were no instructions, I was able to reuse a lot of the code from the
        home page of the coffee shop website. I had to change a couple of image
        references, and the content of the article headline and paragraphs, and
        then add the links so that the pages connect. Changing the html code was a
        simple task, but creating the CSS code was even more simple. I started to
        create a new CSS file for the “Our Roasters” page, but realized that I was
        copying everything exactly from the CSS file of the home page. Knowing
        this, I changed the CSS link in the “Our Roasters” to the one for the home
        page so that both html files reference the same CSS file. The website
        rendered perfectly. This process was a good lesson in simplifying code to
        work to your advantage. It seems that keeping all the html files connected
        to the same CSS file is a good way to keep a website consistent.</p>

      <p>After seeing what could be done with CSS shapes, I had to figure out a
        way to break out of a rectangular grid. I ended up googling some ways to
        make shapes and what I found was pretty amazing. There are some simple
        explanations of how to round corners, or make circle and ovals, but one
        website had a list of code for increasingly complex shapes. It started
        with a circle and ovals and diamonds, but got to hearts, infinity signs,
        stars, and speech bubbles.</p>
      <p>Though the code for these was really intense and definitely not as
        powerful as the code in the article I read, it did work for me in
        codepen. Knowing that it is possible to make shapes besides rectangles
        has spurred my imagination for new website designs. I will look into
        how to make CSS shapes work, but for now I am content knowing that my
        options are open!</p>
