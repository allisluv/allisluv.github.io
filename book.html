    <h6>Design and th ePlay Instinct - Spring 2016</h6>
    <p>I created a book base on the contents of Paul Rand’s article “Desing and
      the Play Instinct.”  The idea was to display the concepts that Paul Rand
      wrote about.</p>

      <p>Acheivements - One of my favorite parts of the book is that the cover
        actually folds over both sides of the book and latches close in the
        front. I played with ways to make a fun shape, but it seemed odd shapes
        were impraticle for putung a book on a shelf. I instead played with ways
        to change the way the reader would hold and interact with the book.</p>
      <p>Challenges - I found it very difficult to work with another’s content.
        It meant that the content could not be altered to fit my design, but my
        design had to be altered to fit the content. In the end, though, as
        Paul Rand would say, the restraints that the content placed on me
        forced me to be more creative with solutions.</p>
