      <h3>Why Hair Dye?</h3>
      <p>Clothing has many purposes including providing protection and modesty,
        designating gender or status, creating a group identity, and protecting
        the wearer. But the primary purpose of clothing is decoration and
        expression. Historians have decided this based on the fact that before
        clothing existed, humans had been expressing themselves thought tattoos,
        body piercings, and hair color.</p>
      <blockquote>"Aesthetic tendencies drift with the cultural currents, but
          our drive to alter ourselves is constant."</blockquote>
      <p>People have been going to extreme measures to dye their hair for
        millennia. Some techniques are gross and some are dangerous. Different
        times and different cultures value different hair qualities and colors.
        Like clothing and tattoos, people keep doing it throughout time and in
        all places. The question now is what we will come up with next!</p>
