    <h6>Wayne Allwine Poster - Fall 2014</h6>
    <p>After researching an artist, I was asked to make up an event honoring
      the artist, then make a poster to advertize it. I chose to honor Wayne
      Allwine, the original voice actor for Mickey Mouse.</p>

      <p>Acheivements - I think one of the greatest acheivement of this poster
        is that it contains many smaller images within one overall image. From
        far away, it would be clear that the poster is about Mickey Mouse, but
        closer, it conveys more detail abiut what will be seen at the event.
        Adding a little bit of color also managed to tmake the poster more
        playful and enticing.</p>
      <p>Challenges - I struggle for a long time with the layout of this Poster
        in its early stages. For a long time I was working with the images as
        aligned rectangles. Though the large Mickey Mouse was one of my first
        ideas, I struggle to match images that would fit inside it. I learned
        that preliminary sketches can be great to go back to when I reach an
        impass with a bad layout.</p>
