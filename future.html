      <h3>The Future of Hair Color</h3>
      <p>	The future of hair color is unraveling as I type. Itâ€™s going to
        include easier, faster, healthier, more permanent methods of
        personalizing hair to any color.</p>
      <p>Permanent neon dye colors already exist, but glow in the dark hair
        color is next! Glow in the dark hair color is already becoming a popular
        art form, but glow in the dark dyes are temporary or semi-permanent. I
        predict that as hair coloring technologies advance, there will me more
        options to make hair glow in the dark, or even more or less translucent
        like glass.</p>
      <p>Scientists are also working on nanotechnology and applying it to hair
        dye. Basically, what this means is that the dye molecules would be far
        smaller and be able to penetrate strands of hair more effectively. This
        would make for brighter, and longer lasting colors.</p>
      <p>The best science out there, however, seems to be heading away from
        using chemical dyes at all. A flat iron type machine may soon be able to
        change hair color instantly as hair passes through it. Instead of using
        chemicals, this process would use an ion beam to change the physical
        shapes that hair molecules make, changing the way it reflects light and
        hence changing the color that the hair appears. In theory, this would
        greatly reduce the time required to color hair and would prevent the
        health risks and side effects associated with exposure to the chemicals
        in dyes.</p>
      <p>Hair shines, curls, and moves like no other material. I imagine that
        the future only holds more efficient, more dramatic ways to design such
        a unique and personal canvas.</p>
