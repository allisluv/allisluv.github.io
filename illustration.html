    <h6>Monochromatic Illustration  - Fall 2014</h6>
    <p>This is an Illustrator drawing that was meant to include a person and be
      drawn in only one hue. It was intended to get used to using the pen
      tool.</p>

      <p>Acheivements - This began as a paper drawing that I had never intended
        to put on the computer. Even as I was just learning to use Illustrator,
        I was able to make this image look a lot like the paper drawing, and
        better in some ways.</p>
      <p>Challenges - One challenge that I faced was picking a color to use. I
        imagined the chair green, but green skin didn’t look healthy. I was
        worried that the blue would have the same problem, but I tinted the
        blue enough to look okay. I think the color gives the drawing a gentle
        tone, almost like it’s under water.</p>
