    <h6>Minimal Letter Forms  - Spring 2016</h6>
    <p>With a 2X2 grid and one letter in each box, I was supposed to create an
      interesting composition by manipulating the size and layout of the
      letters. In this case I used the type Friz Quadrata.</p>

      <p>Acheivements - I tried many different combinations of letters and
        played with moving them around a lot. I decided to use the “b,” “X,”
        “g,” and “e,” characters which allowed me to show some of the most
        unique qualities of the typeface. I managed to create a certain amount
        of flow throughout the composition.</p>
      <p>Challenges - One of the most difficult parts of the exercise was
        narrowing down my choices. I had a few other combinations of letters
        that I thought could turn into great compositions as well. It was
        difficult to figure out witch combination of letters would express the
        typeface the best.</p>
