      <h3>A History of Hair Dye</h3>
      <p>	In ancient times, people dyed their hair primarily with natural and
        herbal methods. Henna was used in many Mediterranean and African
        cultures to make red patterns on hair and skin. Other cultures used
        plants like indigo, cassia, senna, tumeric, and alma for a variety of
        colors and effects.</p>
      <p>Some of the first chemical hair dyes were used in Ancient Greece and
        Rome. The Greeks mixed vinegar and wood ash to create a chemical
        reaction that would bleach their hair. It was actually a fairly
        dangerous chemical reaction that could burn the skin and do significant
        damage to the hair if it used carelessly. Medieval women also aspired
        for lighter hair colors, but they bleached their hair overnight with a
        mixture including white wine and honey.</p>
      <p>Along with gold dust, the Romans were known for mixing leaches and
        earthworms into vinegar to cover graying and achieve a black hair color.
        Ancient Egyptians used a lead-based dye to color their hair (and wigs)
        pitch black. By modern American standards, these methods may seem
        ridiculous.</p>
      <p>Though current hair dyes are more effective and more colorful, they
        still tend to come from dangerous chemicals. In 1856, the chemist
        William Henry Perkin accidentally created an analine, synthetic,
        mauve colored dye. Its first use was in textiles, but in 1907, L’Oreal
        used it to produce the first synthetic hair dye. Forty years later,
        Schwarzkopf launched a line of home coloring products. Since then the
        industry has grown, despite growing concerns for health.</p>
