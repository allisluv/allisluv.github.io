      <h6>About Me</h6>
      <p>I am Allison Love, a Senior Design student at the University of
        California Davis.  My art and design experience was very limited before
        starting college. Since 2013, I’ve grown and learned more than I could
        have hoped for.</p>
      <p>I have been interested in fashion since I was about 8-years-old. I have
        been learning to sew and design clothes since my mother and grandmother
        started to teach me when I was little. It has always been a hobby of
        mine and I have aspired to make a career out of it. Though I cam to UC
        Davis expecting to prepare for a career in fashion, I feel I have
        learned the most about graphic design and typography.</p>
      <p>I have taken most of the fashion classes at UC Davis, and though they
        have fine-tuned my skills, they have not transformed me the way my
        graphic design classes have. My knowledge and experience with graphic
        design started from zero in the fall of 2013. Now, in the fall of 2016,
        I’ve learned how to use form, color, scale, contrast, proximity, type,
        and more to communicate emotion and information. I have used the skills
        from my graphic design classes in my fashion classes, and even in my
        every day life.</p>
      <p>Graphic design and typography are like the half of my life that I
        didn’t know I didn’t know about. Now that I know how to use it, I can’t
        image how I accomplished anything without it.</p>
