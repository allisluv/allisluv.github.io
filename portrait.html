    <h6>High Contrast Portrait  - Fall 2014</h6>
    <p>This was done in Photoshop as an attempt to turn a photo of an artist
      into a high contrast portrait with a distinct color scheme and without
      loosing the essence of the artist.</p>

      <p>Acheivements - I chose to use a portrait of Amy Whinehouse. The
        original image is represented by the black. The rest of the color
        scheme works very well because the high contrast in the green and red.
        I think the red in the lips stands out and gives the image a little of
        Amy Winehouseâ€™s eccentricities. </p>
      <p>Challenges - The darker green stripes in the background were added to
        fill empty space. I had to decide how best to fill the space. I played
        with shape and color, but it seemed best to keep it simple: straight
        lines and and a darker shade of the same green as the background.</p>
