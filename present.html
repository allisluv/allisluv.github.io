      <h3>Techniques and Designs of Today</h3>
      <p>	In 2016, people are doing amazing things with their hair, but it often
        comes at a price. Now, 80% of women and a little over 50% of the
        population uses hair dyes to alter their appearance.</p>
      <p>As expected in the twenty first century, different people take their
        hair in different directions. Some people use bleaches and dyes to mimic
        the natural hair colors of others. Some use dyes to change the color of
        graying roots to match their natural hair color. Others dye their hair
        one or more bright colors to make a statement. Finally, many people dye
        their hair back to their original hair color so that they donâ€™t get
        awkward roots when they are done with whatever their latest look
        was.</p>
      <p>Recently, individuals have produced some intricate hairstyles,
        combining color with cuts, curls, and braids. One common trend is
        dip-dyeing, or fading long hair vertically between two or more colors.
        It can be from a natural tone to a bright color, or from one bright
        color to another. Some people even include the whole rainbow in their
        hair.</p>
      <p>Another trend has been dyeing roots, and ends separately, but very
        deliberately, so that, when French braided, the braid is a different
        color, or colors alternate through the braid rhythmically.</p>
      <p>For a very bold statement, some people have been splitting their hair
        straight down the middle and coloring each side a different color. The
        effect is very Cruela Devil-esque, but usually involves much brighter
        colors than black and white.</p>
      <p>Finally, blocking has become very popular. For this, chunks of hair are
        dyed different colors based on placement both horizontally and
        vertically. The two-toned split mentioned above is one of the simpler
        examples of blocking. Because hair has a lot of fluid movement, color
        blocks tend to present as very colorful hair. But coupled with a
        designed buzz cut, color blocking is now being used to create geometric
        patterns and novelty motifs in spots of hair, right against the
        scalp.</p>
      <p>Though there are really cool things to do with hair dyes, the process
        is intensive and can create some unhealthy side effects. Hair can be
        colored professionally or at home, but either way, it can take anywhere
        from 2-16 hours, depending on the intricacy of the design. It is also
        practically impossible to do on your own without dyeing your hands,
        ears, or face. Dark hair requires bleaching so that lighter colors can
        show up. The more bleach and the more dye used on hair, the weaker and
        the dryer it gets.</p>
      <p>In addition to damage to the hair itself, many people have bad skin
        reactions to the chemicals in dyes. People endure weeks of blisters and
        scabs in order to dye their hair. Some dyes claim to be more gentle than
        others, but all dyes instruct testing on a smaller area of the hair,
        near the scalp to see if there will be a reaction.</p>
      <p>Some doctors are even looking into whether hair dyes can be linked with
        blood and bone cancers like lymphoma and leukemia. So far some tests
        have made a connection, while others have shown no connection, so
        results are inconclusive. With so many people using hair dyes now, the
        health risks are really important to know about and avoid.</p>
