      the pattern would look like as a final prduct.</p>

      <p>Acheivements - I enjoyed putting this presentation board together
        because it showed the process behind the final product that most people
        would see. Though typograpgy plays a relatively small role in this
        peice I did have to make sure that I was using colors with enough
        contrast.</p>
      <p>Challenges - Because the patterns consist of so may colors, picking
        background colors that wouldnâ€™t clash and brought all three colorways
        together was difficults. I also struggled at first to seperate the left
        and right sides of the board before deciding to use two different
        background colors.</p>
