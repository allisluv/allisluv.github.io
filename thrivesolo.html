      <p>Is thrivesolo.com responsive? The short answer is yes. The code does
        seem to be set up for the page to mold to fit a screen of any size. The
        long answer is that the website definitely looks better and is easier
        to navigate at certain sizes.</p>

      <p>The color scheme and the layout are very simple, which seems to be a
        criteria for responsive sites. Each page of the site only has two
        colors: white and blue, purple, or gray. The layout simply has text and
        images broken up vertically by a dotted line. Between the dotted lines,
        one block of text is to the side (some on the left, some on the right)
        of an image. At least this is how it looks on a larger screen.</p>

      <p>Because the site is so simple, it’s not jarring to shrink the site down
        until the text and image cannot fit side by side. When this happens, it
        stacks the writing and images vertically instead (the left element on
        top of the right element). It doesn’t disrupt the flow of the vertical
        flow of the document whatsoever. Because the images and text switch
        sides, though, the vertical flow becomes image, image, text, text, and
        so on for a smaller screen. It may be more effective if the flow were
        text, image, text image on a small screen, but that would require a more
        boring flow on a larger screen of having all the text on the left and
        all the images on the right.</p>

      <p>The type moves through stages of looking very good and looking slightly
        awkward. The text can be one of two sizes depending on how large the
        screen is. Intuitively, the type is larger on larger screens, and
        smaller to fit onto smaller screens. Each font has a range of screen
        sizes for which it is used, and each looks great at the largest screen
        size within its range. It makes for beautiful text boxes that are
        approximately the same height as their corresponding images. At the
        smallest screen for each font size, on the other hand, the text becomes
        only one word wide and much taller than it’s image before shrinking down
        to the next font size.</p>

      <p>The navigation bar transitions fairly well from larger to smaller
        screens, but looses some important qualities. On larger screens, the
        navigation bar is horizontal, is fixed at the top of the screen, and has
        links to three pages and to sign in and sign up for a trial. As the
        screen shrinks, first the trial and sign in links move under the other
        links. This is effective. But when the screen is too small for the width
        of the horizontal bar, the links for the three pages stack vertically
        and the other two links disappear. Though those links can be found other
        places in the site, it is less convenient than having them all in the
        same place at the top of the page. The navigation bar also unfixes and
        scrolls off the screen. This is necessary so that it doesn’t take up
        valuable space from the rest of the site, but it does make the links
        less accessible.</p>
